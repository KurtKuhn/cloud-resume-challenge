## Foreward

This is my first post on my very first blog.  The goal of this blog is to document
my journey of doing the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)
I've been looking to expand my skills with AWS services, GitHub Actions and Terraform.

The code for the frontend will be done with Hugo. I purchased this domain with AWS Route53.
As of right now, CloudFront handles the content distrubition with a SSL cert from ACM.
I have already set these up and will do another post soon with my experience with that.

### What Is Hugo?

Hugo is an open source static site generator.  It uses Go to produce HTML files from markdown files

### Installing Hugo

If you have Homebrew installed on Mac, it is quite easy. Simply run the command from your terminal:

```
  brew install hugo
```
