## Foreward

This is my first post on my very first blog.  The goal of this blog is to document
my journey of doing the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)
The challenge itself is using AWS services for the backend and content distrubition.  
As well, I'll be attempting infrastructure as code, mainly through Terraform. The CI/CD
process with GitHub Actions.

I'm somewhat comfortable with the more well known AWS service, such as Lambda and DynamoDB.
I'm trying to really understand Terraform and the CI/CD process and how it falls to grand scheme.

This project requires code for the frontend and that will be done with Hugo.  
The logic for hugo is I'm not looking to hone my frontend skills, so I would like to experiment with a new framework

### What Is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open source static site generator.  It uses Go to produce HTML files from markdown files
